# Prompt engineering for overview

## for `openai-overview-prompteng.py`

The idea is to use openAI API / annex AI to get more insight on specific markets.

The advantage in doing so is we are able to get extensive information on what makes a specific market unique, and what we need to take into account.

Steps to make the code work:

1) Set the OpenAI API key in windows console

```
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
```

2) In `openai-overview-prompteng.py`, change the `market` variable to choose the relevant market

3) Get the reponse in a machine readable format once the code finishes running.

4) Profit / More to come

## for `perplexity.py`

1) Select the keyword from `topics.json`

2) Paste it

3) Run the code

# Important TODO: remove the API key from the python script
